## Article I Found Interesting 
[The Rise of Worse is Better][https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html]

What I find interesting about Richard Gabriel’s “The Rise of Worse is Better” is how it challenges the instinctive belief that the “best” or most elegant technical design will naturally win out. Gabriel’s comparison between the MIT “do the right thing” philosophy and the Unix/C “worse-is-better” approach highlights a counterintuitive but deeply practical insight: software that is simpler to implement, even if imperfect or incomplete, often spreads faster and survives longer. The argument that Unix and C succeeded not because they were ideal, but because they were portable, resource efficient, and “good enough,” reframes success in software engineering as an evolutionary process rather than a purely technical one. This perspective feels especially relevant today, where tools and systems that prioritize ease of adoption and iteration frequently outperform more theoretically elegant alternatives. The article ultimately made me think more critically about tradeoffs between correctness, completeness, and real-world usability, and how engineering decisions shape not just software quality, but entire ecosystems of developers.
